Classifying Turkish tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories, with Zemberek, using tf-idf for feature extraction and k-NN for classification, while evaluating performance with stratified 10-fold cross-validation

Key Steps
Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and tf-idf calculation.
Classification: Implement k-NN with Cosine Similarity and experiment with different k values.
Evaluation: Calculate Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix without built-in libraries.
